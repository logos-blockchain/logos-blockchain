  @local_transactions
  Scenario: Local continuous coin split transactions round robin
    Given the genesis block has the following wallet resources:
      | account_index | token_count | token_amount |
      | 1             | 3           | 6000000      |
      | 2             | 3           | 6000000      |
      | 3             | 3           | 6000000      |
      | 4             | 3           | 6000000      |

      | 10            | 3           | 6000000      |
    And I will have tokio console profile nodes:
      | node_name | record_raw |
      | NODE_LATE | true       |
    And I have a cluster with capacity of 11 nodes
    And I start nodes with wallet resources:
      | node_name | account_index | wallet_name | connected_to |
      | NODE_1    | 1             | WALLET_01A  |              |
      | NODE_2    | 2             | WALLET_02A  | NODE_1       |
      | NODE_3    | 3             | WALLET_03A  | NODE_1       |
      | NODE_4    | 4             | WALLET_04A  | NODE_1       |
      | NODE_5    | 5             | WALLET_05A  | NODE_1       |

      | NODE_9    | 9             | WALLET_09A  | NODE_8       |
      | NODE_10   | 10            | WALLET_10A  | NODE_9       |
    And I log diagnostic identities
    When node "NODE_1" is at height 2 in 300 seconds
    When I perform continuous transactions on user wallets with 250 coin split outputs of 20000 LGO, 250 transactions of 8000 LGO each for 3 cycles with 3 epochs headroom
    When I log wallet balances for all wallets
    When I start peer node "NODE_LATE" connected to node "NODE_1"
    When all nodes converged to within 0 blocks in 3000 seconds
    When I log wallet balances for all wallets
    Then I stop all nodes
